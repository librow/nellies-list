# Overview

This project pulls in books from a json object stored in the project. Those books are then displayed on the site and users can search and filter through the books.

## Lessons Learned
A. Tailwind is a super easy way to style elements
B. Using grid and flexbox together can cause some confusion, probably best practice to use one or the other for most cases
C. The component format of React really simplafies the web app and provides a good way of thinking about structure
